Game Description: This is a Sudoku puzzle generator and a Sudoku puzzle solver. A Sudoku puzzle is a game in which users insert the numbers one to nine into a table of nine squares by nine squares, in such a way that every number appears in each horizontal line, vertical line, and ' three by three box' only once. The Suokdu game can generate puzzles to solve (you can choose seeds), and the solver can solve puzzles.
